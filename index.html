	<h1>Welcome to my training page!</h1>
	<p>This will be my webpage for learing web development along with javascript, nodejs, css, and other tools!. I will be using this page a sort of a blog to track my progress.</p>

	<h2>Ideas to try:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Add text box to page that writes to page on save.</li>
		<li>still more to do, off to bed</li>
	</ul>
